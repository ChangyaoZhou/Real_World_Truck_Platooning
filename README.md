# Real_World_Truck_Platooning
The aim of this project lies in following a chosen vehicle, which can traverse various trajectories with different velocities. The designed model should estimate steering angle and desired velocity to successfully chase the target car. Our  approach  can  be  easily  transferredto the real-world applications of vehicle platooning, whichwould hopefully inspire future research in this direction
